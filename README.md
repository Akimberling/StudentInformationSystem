##Introduction to project:

###Project: Student Information System 

###Roles:   
*	Amber Kimberling(Lead): Scrum Master

Through the process of this project Team D learned about how to work in a team of individuals with different backgrounds and specialities. While navigating through the project together we discovered that physically assigning work to individuals made each of us more accountable to the work we produce. After each scrum meeting we began becoming more efficient with our communication and with our production of work. By the third sprint we had a well defined process that produced capable solutions to our assigned user stories.. 

###Future enhancements to our software and the process:   
*	Be more detail oriented with the features we produced  
 *	Secure login, separate interfaces for each user, etc…  
*	Increase our scrum meeting time by 30 min   
*	Create more content for the product  
*	Develop authentication and sessions in the software  
*	Delegate work evenly to each team member  
*	Implement more structure and defined responsibilities into the team
